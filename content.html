            <p>This project was created with the express purpose of calculating monthly expenses,
                disposable income, and debt-to-income ratios and much more. By reporting these metrics 
                as a percentage of income, the goal is to give a simple, quick and 
                intuitive representation of expenses. Please see the usage section of this website for intructions
                on usage and documentation.
