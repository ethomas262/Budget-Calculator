    <h2 class = "subheading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This budget calculator was created by none other than Elijah Thomas.<br>
        A pretty new guy to front end developent but thanks to the HTML<br> 
        course at codecademy he was able to write a simple HTML file to display this content!<br>
        Hopefully he will learn some js at some point so he can actually start running this budget<br>
        calculator but until then, stay tuned!
